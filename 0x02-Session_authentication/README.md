In this project, we will implement a Session Authentication. You are not allowed to install any other module. This project focuses on managing user sessions, securing user data, and ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.

**Features:**

- **Session Management:** Handle user sessions securely using cookies or tokens.
- **Authentication:** Verify user credentials and establish sessions.
- **Authorization:** Restrict access to certain resources based on user roles or permissions.
